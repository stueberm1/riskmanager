= Risk Manager
[[main-purpose]]
Is a tool to manage and track identified technical risks and -depts in agile driven software projects.
It supports creation and assessment of risks. They can get prioritized and grouped to get them a context.

Risks and risk-groups can get assigned to a project context, so the risks and technical depts can get managed for multiple
projects in one instance.

Riskmanager provides user-interfaces for direct interaction as well as apis for integration in any project management tool.

Defined extension points allows to add custom and potentially proprietary tools and persistence options as
plugin, without need to integrate them in the project directly.
