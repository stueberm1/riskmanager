=== Quality Goals

[options="header", cols="1,3"]
|===
|Quality goal           | Motivation and explanation
| easy integration      | We do not want to tell project-managers and software architects how to manage their projects. Therefor it provides java and web-apis to integrate it in existing tools.
| easy introduction     | Any interface (web as well as java) is fully documented to allow users to integrate the tool in any way they need.
| persistence agnostic  | We do not know how users want to use and integrate the tool, so it provides documented extension points to plugin filesystem based persistence as well as database bases persistence.
| easy adaption         | We do not know how users need to track there technical risks and depts, so it provides extension points to adept the system to the needs of the concrete users.
